# Graphiti

*Prototype tool for Interactive Specification of Attribute-based Edges for Network Modeling and Visualization.*

## Running Locally

(Steps and prototype tested with python3.x)

1. Setup a virtual environment `virtualenv venv`. If you do not have the virtualenv command installed, refer to [this site](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html). **Note**: This step is only needed the first time the setup is being performed.
2. Activate the virtual environment (e.g., `source venv/bin/activate`), and install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Start the local server `python app.py`
4. Go to http://localhost:5000/ to run the system (preloaded with an imdb movies dataset)
